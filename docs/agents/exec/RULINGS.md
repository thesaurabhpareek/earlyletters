# Executive rulings log

Rulings by the council executives other than the CTO (Karma's are in `docs/agents/cto/RULINGS.md`). The protocol is `docs/agents/exec/COUNCIL.md`, section 5. Each entry uses the format in Karma's skill, section 11, and the role code with the next number for that role (`CLO-1`, `CFO-1`). Before numbering, check this file, any open PRs that touch it, and the Project docs `infra/exec-rulings-*`. The founder can overrule any entry in one line, recorded as a new entry that supersedes the old one. Newest last.

### CPO-1 Keep is the commit verb in the PRD (31 Oct 2026, CPO via the platform session)
- Question: F06-REQ-043 says actions say "Save"; the decisions say the parent taps Keep. Which does the spec say?
- Tier and type: T1; clear
- Options considered: keep the requirement as written and change the app; amend the requirement to Keep; leave both and record the conflict
- Ruling: amend F06-REQ-043, F06 section 6.2 ("Save to {child}'s book", "Save just for me"), `F14-plus.md:165` ("taps Save") and add a superseded note on DISPOSITION-C DX-08 (`:87`). The amended P0 row names its test and work package, so the RR-3 ratchet (D-123) still passes.
- Why: D-083 has the parent tap Keep and counts letters kept; D-109's effects say "keeps it on Write"; the app already follows them. A requirement row fixed against a decision of record is the CPO's (CPO skill section 4). Nomenclature audit R-B, PR #422.
- Door: two-way
- Way back: revert the PRD rows.
- Revisit when: a device test shows parents read Keep wrongly at the gate.

### CDO-1 One approval enum, no `withdrawn` (31 Oct 2026, CDO via the platform session)
- Question: the API's sync enum accepts `withdrawn`, which core, the database check and DATA_CLASSIFICATION do not. Keep it?
- Tier and type: T1; complicated
- Options considered: leave it; add `withdrawn` to the database and core; drop it from the API and import core's `APPROVALS`
- Ruling: after the API owner confirms nothing sends it, drop `withdrawn` from `packages/api/src/server/sync.ts:84` and import core's `APPROVALS`, with a test that core, the API and the database check match. Analytics builds its approval enum from core too, so `kept_aside` becomes `set_aside` (audit R-G).
- Why: the API accepts a value the database refuses (`supabase/migrations/20261003000000_security_and_family.sql:396`), and the word collides with consent withdrawal (D-128). No emitter found by grep; intent UNVERIFIED, and production rows UNVERIFIED (production sits at migration 2).
- Door: two-way
- Way back: restore the literal enum.
- Revisit when: the API owner shows a sender.

### CPrivO-1 Sharing claims held from submission (31 Oct 2026, CPrivO via the platform session)
- Question: the store source still says "Private to your family", "Invite your co-parent" and "Only you and the people you invite can read your book". Can a submission carry them?
- Tier and type: T1; clear
- Options considered: allow them; hold them until the store fix lands; rewrite them here
- Ruling: no submission carries `store.en.ts:28,54,60` until the store fix lands (BL-440, now carried by `fix/comms-validation-2026-10-31`). Verify step: the rule test in `rules.test.ts`. The CCO also checks "delete everything, any time, from Settings" against the build before submission (no erase-all control found; UNVERIFIED).
- Why: the first store build has no sharing (D-121, D-126); guideline 2.3.1(a).
- Door: two-way
- Way back: lift the hold in one line here.
- Revisit when: the store fix merges.

### CLO-1 Two pieces of legal draft hygiene (31 Oct 2026, CLO via the platform session; not legal advice)
- Question: the Subscription Terms on `develop` show superseded prices, and the Terms say "a member's access". What happens to them before counsel?
- Tier and type: T1; clear
- Options considered: publish as is; fix the text now; hold publication and route to counsel
- Ruling: `docs/legal/subscription-terms.md` is never published from `develop` while it shows $3.99 and $29.99 (`:32-33`); the D-082 text is reconciled with counsel before submission. In the Terms, "a member's access" (`terms-of-service.md:157`) becomes "a person's access" until counsel picks one defined term. The founder merges both (D-125).
- Why: a subscriber reading the old price and being charged the new one is a refund and a complaint. Audit NA-08, NA-29.
- Door: two-way
- Way back: revert the line.
- Revisit when: counsel answers Q8.

### CCO-1 The listing can't say "exactly as you said it" (31 Oct 2026, CCO via the platform session; not counsel)
- Question: how do we keep D-125 item 9 from drifting back into the store copy?
- Tier and type: T1; clear
- Options considered: rely on review; a checklist line; a rules test
- Ruling: `packages/content/test/rules.test.ts` fails if `storeListing` contains "exactly as you said it", until counsel clears the phrase at T30.
- Why: D-125 item 9 holds the phrase from the listing; guideline 2.3.1(a). A test enforces it; a checklist relies on memory.
- Door: two-way
- Way back: delete the test line when counsel clears it.
- Revisit when: counsel answers Q16.
