# Applying pending migrations to the live project

For the founder. Project: `early-letters` (Supabase, us-west-1). Written 2 Oct 2026.
Nothing here has been run against the live project yet. Do the steps in order; each has a check and a rollback.

## What is applied and what is pending

| Order | File | State | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `20260930000000_scribe_core.sql` | Applied | Schema, RLS, photo bucket |
| 2 | `20261001000000_scribe_hardening.sql` | Applied 2 Oct as `scribe_hardening_indexes_and_grants` | Function grants, FK indexes |
| 3 | `20261002010000_entries_select_policy.sql` | **Pending** | One SELECT policy on entries instead of two (performance only) |
| 4 | `20261002020000_data_governance.sql` | **Pending** | Deletion, retention, legal holds, audit, policy acceptances, author-only raw transcripts (`book_entries` view), per-child settings, drops `safety_events`, classification comments on every column |

Step 4 drops whatever entries SELECT policies exist, so it is correct whether or not step 3 ran. Apply 3 first anyway, so the live history matches the repo.

## Before you start (10 minutes)

1. On your Mac, in the repo: `npm install` then `npm run test:db`. All four test files must pass (`classification`, `data_governance`, `perf`, `rls`). Do not continue if anything fails.
2. In the Supabase dashboard, Database > Backups: confirm a daily backup from the last 24 hours exists. If you want an exact restore point, run `supabase db dump --linked -f backup-2026-10-02.sql` (needs the Supabase CLI linked to the project). Storage files are not in database backups; nothing here touches Storage objects.
3. Pick a quiet time. Today only founder data exists, so there is no user impact, but the app build that reads co-parent letters must switch to `book_entries` (section "App changes") before any co-parent uses it.

## Step 1. Apply the entries policy (pending file 3)

1. Dashboard > SQL Editor > New query. Paste the whole of `supabase/migrations/20261002010000_entries_select_policy.sql` (it has its own `begin` / `commit`). Run.
2. Check:
   ```sql
   select policyname from pg_policies where schemaname = 'public' and tablename = 'entries' order by 1;
   ```
   Expect `entries_author_insert`, `entries_author_update`, `entries_select`.
3. Record it in the migration history so the CLI does not try to re-run it:
   ```sql
   insert into supabase_migrations.schema_migrations (version, name) values ('20261002010000', 'entries_select_policy')
   on conflict do nothing;
   ```

Rollback for step 1 (only if reads break):
```sql
begin;
create policy entries_author_select on public.entries for select to authenticated using (author_id = (select auth.uid()));
create policy entries_book_select on public.entries for select to authenticated
  using (in_book and deleted_at is null and public.is_child_member(child_id));
drop policy entries_select on public.entries;
commit;
```

## Step 2. Pre-flight checks for the governance migration

Run in the SQL Editor and read the numbers. None of these change data.
```sql
-- a) Photo paths that would fail the new scoping rule ({child}/{author}/{entry}.jpg|jpeg|heic|png).
select id, photo_path from public.entries
 where photo_path is not null
   and photo_path !~ ('^' || child_id || '/' || author_id || '/' || id || '\.(jpg|jpeg|heic|png)$');
-- b) Rows in safety_events (the migration deletes the table and its rows, by design: PRD K-06).
select count(*) from public.safety_events;
-- c) Nothing else may already use the new names.
select to_regclass('public.book_entries'), to_regclass('public.policy_acceptances'), to_regclass('public.audit_events');
```
Expect: (a) no rows, (b) any number (they will be erased; they are a health inference we decided not to keep), (c) three nulls. If (a) returns rows, fix or clear those `photo_path` values before step 5; the constraint is added `NOT VALID`, so step 3 still works.

## Step 3. Apply the governance migration (file 4)

1. SQL Editor > New query. Type `begin;` on the first line, paste the whole of `supabase/migrations/20261002020000_data_governance.sql`, and type `commit;` on the last line. Run. If any statement fails, the whole thing rolls back and nothing changes; copy the error and stop.
2. Record it:
   ```sql
   insert into supabase_migrations.schema_migrations (version, name) values ('20261002020000', 'data_governance')
   on conflict do nothing;
   ```

## Step 4. Check the result

```sql
-- Every public column is classified (expect 0).
select count(*) from pg_class c join pg_namespace n on n.oid = c.relnamespace
  join pg_attribute a on a.attrelid = c.oid
 where n.nspname = 'public' and c.relkind in ('r','v') and a.attnum > 0 and not a.attisdropped
   and coalesce(col_description(c.oid, a.attnum), '') !~ '^L[1-4]\M';
-- Every public table has RLS (expect 0).
select count(*) from pg_class c join pg_namespace n on n.oid = c.relnamespace
 where n.nspname = 'public' and c.relkind = 'r' and not c.relrowsecurity;
-- safety_events is gone (expect null).
select to_regclass('public.safety_events');
-- Book creator deletion no longer cascades (expect 'n' = SET NULL).
select confdeltype from pg_constraint where conname = 'children_created_by_fkey';
-- Policy documents seeded (expect 13).
select count(*) from public.policy_documents;
```
Then Dashboard > Advisors > Security and Performance. Expected and accepted:
- **0010 security definer view** on `public.book_entries`. Intentional: the view applies its own membership rule and hides raw transcripts (PRD K-09). `my_policy_state` is `security_invoker` and should not appear.
- **0029 authenticated can execute security definer function** for the RPCs users call: `create_child`, `create_child_invite`, `accept_child_invite`, `request_account_deletion`, `cancel_account_deletion`, `request_book_deletion`, `cancel_book_deletion`, `delete_entry`, `restore_entry`, `set_member_auto_add`, `record_policy_act`, `policy_actions_needed`, and the RLS helpers `is_child_member`, `is_child_parent`, `child_is_live`, `can_read_entry_photo`. Each checks `auth.uid()`.
Anything else new: stop and ask.

## Step 5. Validate the photo path rule

Only after step 2(a) returns no rows:
```sql
alter table public.entries validate constraint entries_photo_path_scoped;
```
Rollback: none needed; if it fails, nothing changed.

## Step 6. Set the consent pepper (before any account deletion runs)

Policy acceptances are kept 3 years after an account is deleted, under a peppered hash of the old user id. Generate a random value once (for example `openssl rand -hex 32`), store it in your password manager, and set it:
```sql
alter database postgres set app.consent_pepper = '<the random value>';
```
Never change it afterwards (old and new hashes would no longer match). Whether Supabase Vault is a better home for it is **Unverified**; the database setting works with the migration as written. Anyone with database owner access can read it, which is acceptable for a pseudonymisation pepper but not for a key.

## Step 7. Schedule the purge

Dashboard > Integrations > Cron (enables `pg_cron`), then:
```sql
select cron.schedule('scribe-purge-due', '17 * * * *', $$ select public.purge_due(); $$);
```
The `purge-worker` Edge Function (Storage deletion and account execution) is not built yet. Until it exists, letters and books are purged from Postgres on time, Storage paths queue up in `storage_purge_queue`, and account requests wait in `executing`. That is safe, but the published 31-day promise needs the worker before the first non-founder deletion.

Rollback: `select cron.unschedule('scribe-purge-due');`

## App changes that must ship with or before step 3 reaching real families

- Co-parents and contributors read other people's letters from `book_entries`, not `entries` (the `entries` table now returns only your own letters). PowerSync Sync Streams for members must select from `book_entries` columns; the author's own stream may use `entries`.
- `uploadData` treats SQLSTATEs `SCIMM`, `SCTMB`, `SCLPG`, `SCDEL` and the new `SCPAR` (parents-only book setting) as permanent, not retryable.
- Restoring a deleted letter uses `restore_entry()`; clearing `deleted_at` directly is refused.
- Photo paths must be `{child_id}/{author_id}/{entry_id}.jpg` (or `.jpeg`, `.heic`, `.png`).
- Safety tiers stay in the local database only; there is no server table to write to.

## Rolling back step 3 after it committed

Prefer fixing forward with a new migration. Never re-introduce `on delete cascade` on `children.created_by` (it deletes co-parents' letters). If reads break for co-parents and the app cannot ship the `book_entries` change in time, this restores the previous read model without losing any data:
```sql
begin;
drop policy if exists entries_select on public.entries;
create policy entries_select on public.entries for select to authenticated using (
  author_id = (select auth.uid())
  or (in_book and deleted_at is null and public.is_child_member(child_id) and public.child_is_live(child_id)));
drop policy if exists entry_photos_read on storage.objects;
create policy entry_photos_read on storage.objects for select to authenticated using (
  bucket_id = 'entry-photos'
  and ((storage.foldername(name))[2] = (select auth.uid())::text or public.can_read_entry_photo(name)));
commit;
```
This re-exposes other authors' raw transcripts to book members (the K-09 problem); use it only as a short bridge.

Everything else in the migration is additive (new tables, columns, functions, triggers, comments). The one destructive change is dropping `safety_events`; its rows exist only in backups taken before step 3, and restoring them would contradict PRD K-06. A full rollback means restoring the database backup from "Before you start" (Storage is unaffected).

## Performance budgets

`npm run test:db` includes `supabase/tests/perf.test.mjs`: 1,000 families x 400 letters (400,000 entries, 354 MB with indexes), queried as a signed-in co-parent through RLS and `book_entries`. It fails if any plan sequentially scans `entries`, `children` or `child_members`, or if a p95 exceeds its budget. Times are server-side execution in PGlite (single-threaded WASM Postgres), 200 samples after 20 warm-up queries; native Postgres on Supabase is faster, and the client-side budget including the network is PRD 7.2 (read p95 300 ms).

| Query | What | Measured p95 (2 Oct 2026) | Budget p95 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `book_page` | 60 newest in-book letters of one book | 6.1 ms | 15 ms |
| `book_full` | Every in-book letter of one book (about 356) | 8.5 to 8.8 ms | 25 ms |
| `search_common` | Full-text search, common words, one book | 3.8 to 4.0 ms | 12 ms |
| `search_rare` | Full-text search, rare word, one book | 3.7 to 3.8 ms | 12 ms |
| `letter_member` | One letter through `book_entries` | 1.3 to 1.8 ms | 4 ms |
| `letter_author` | One own letter from `entries` (with raw transcript) | 0.9 to 1.2 ms | 4 ms |

Plans: book and search queries use the new partial index `entries_book_page_idx (child_id, occurred_on desc, captured_at desc) where in_book and deleted_at is null`; membership is resolved once per query from `child_members_profile_idx`, so cost follows the reader's own books, not the number of families. Synthetic letters are about 24 words; real letters are longer, which mainly affects search recheck time. Scale knobs: `PERF_FAMILIES`, `PERF_ENTRIES`, `PERF_SAMPLES`; `npm run test:db:perf` runs only this test.
