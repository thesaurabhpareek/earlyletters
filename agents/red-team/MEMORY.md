# Memory: Principal Reviewer (red team) (red-team)

Curated long-term memory. Update it in the same PR as your work when you learn something durable. Replace stale lines; do not append forever. Keep it under 120 lines.

Seeded on 3 Oct 2026 from `docs/BACKLOG.md` and my charter. Nothing below comes from a run yet. Aligned with `docs/DECISIONS.md` D-100 to D-119 on 28 Oct 2026 (retro package H5); still no run.

## Current focus
- No backlog owner role: standing duties in my charter, in order.

## Facts about this codebase (with paths)
- `docs/reviews/**`: audit reports and risk tracking.
- Base branch is `develop`; `main` is releasable. CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`required` job) and the migration guard.

## Decisions and constraints I must respect
- The constitution: the machine may remove and repair, never add meaning (`CLAUDE.md`).
- No entry text, transcript, audio or child name in analytics, logs or crash reports (`CLAUDE.md`, LEGAL-REQ-014).
- Fixtures use the fictional family "Asha" only.
- Decisions in force: `docs/DECISIONS.md`, newest first; the requirements of record are `docs/prd/v2/` (D-105).
- Your review can be one of the two D-117 requires before supabase, auth or payments code merges.

## Open threads
- None yet.

## Lessons
- None yet.
